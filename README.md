# Soundboard
A soundboard built into a RichTextbox to be used for things like Theatre to merge tracking the play and playing sounds together in one single program.

## How to use?

- Create a .script file
- Import it
- Do what you want!

### Known issues

- Because the program loads the file in when the mouse is hovered over a button to gain time when it is clicked on, it will cause a crash if the file is not found in where it should have been. This is technically your issue, but I thought some of you may be like "wow i hovered on a button and it crashed 11/10 perfect program" and wrote it here. So, check it out!

### Anything you recommend?

- I highly recommend keeping sound files in the same directory as the executable.

### Frequently Asked Questions
#### What the hell is a .script file?

It is just plain text file, where buttons are inserted into the text using the following format:

`[[file=Path/To/Sound/File.wav|text=What you want the button to say.]]`

Where, the following file:

`test text 1 [[file=Laugh.wav|text=Laugh button test]] test text 2`

will be converted into this:

#### Does the sound files have to be `.wav`?

Yes.

#### Do I have to create .script files manually?

Yes.

#### Why don't you just add a window to do that with a UI?

Yes.

#### "Yes" is not an answer to this question.

Oh, I was looking away. Answer for the last question is, I am a lazy person.

Also, manually creating that file is not very hard either. (I tried :D)
